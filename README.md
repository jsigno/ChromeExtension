The project's main purpose was to gain a better understanding of APIs, and it was a great opportunity to put my coding skills to the test. I chose to use the CoinRanking API to display cryptocurrency data and built a simple UI to render the information on the screen.

Creating a Chrome extension was a great learning experience. Not only did it require me to brush up on my JavaScript skills, but it also taught me about Chrome's extension architecture and how to create a manifest file to provide the necessary permissions.

Overall, I'm thrilled with what I accomplished in just a day and excited to continue exploring different APIs and building more Chrome extensions in the future.
